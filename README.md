In agentic RL, long-horizon rollouts are increasingly long-tailed: a small number of stragglers dominate wall-clock time while many GPUs sit underutilized.

RLix addresses this by time-sharing GPUs across concurrent RL training jobs, expanding rollout workers onto temporarily idle capacity and shrinking them when that capacity is needed elsewhere. RLix does not change pipeline-level training semantics: each recipe retains its original behavior, whether on-policy or off-policy under staleness bounds, while delivering much higher GPU utilization.

RLix builds on **Partial Overlapping** scheduling from [**Alibaba/ROLL**](https://github.com/alibaba/ROLL) and extends it with a distributed control plane for coordinating multiple independent training jobs on a shared GPU cluster.

RLix is an AI-native project, with AI deeply involved across design, planning, implementation, testing, and code review, alongside human oversight. Correctness, code quality, and maintainability remain first-class concerns.
## Features

- **Recipe-Transparent Scheduling**: Training logic stays fully decoupled from GPU scheduling, so each pipeline can be developed in isolation.
- **Two-Level GPU Sharing**: GPUs are shared both across pipelines through elastic expand/shrink and within a pipeline through multi-LoRA adapters on a shared base model.
- **Demand-Driven Rollout Scaling**: Rollout workers expand onto idle GPU capacity and shrink based on heartbeat-reported demand.
- **Efficient Memory Management**: Model weights are cached on the trainer CPU and synced on demand only to resumed rollout workers; when workers shrink, inference weights are dropped to minimize memory footprint.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rlops/rlix.git
cd rlix
pip install -e .
````

## Quick Start

The example below shows a minimal control-plane setup for registering and running a pipeline under RLix.

```python
import ray
import rlix
from rlix.pipeline import PipelineCoordinator
from rlix.protocol.types import COORDINATOR_ACTOR_NAME_PREFIX

# Pipeline-specific configuration object
my_config = ...

# 1. Initialize the RLix control plane
orchestrator = rlix.init(create_if_missing=True)

# 2. Allocate a pipeline ID
pipeline_id = ray.get(orchestrator.allocate_pipeline_id.remote("ft"))

# 3. Register the pipeline's GPU topology
ray.get(
    orchestrator.register_pipeline.remote(
        pipeline_id=pipeline_id,
        ray_namespace=f"pipeline_{pipeline_id}_NS",
        cluster_tp_configs={"actor_train": 8, "actor_infer": 8},
        cluster_device_mappings={
            "actor_train": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
            "actor_infer": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
        },
    )
)

# 4. Admit the pipeline before GPU allocation
ray.get(orchestrator.admit_pipeline.remote(pipeline_id=pipeline_id))

# 5. Create the pipeline coordinator
CoordinatorActor = ray.remote(PipelineCoordinator)
coordinator = CoordinatorActor.options(
    name=f"{COORDINATOR_ACTOR_NAME_PREFIX}{pipeline_id}",
    namespace=f"pipeline_{pipeline_id}_NS",
).remote(pipeline_id=pipeline_id, pipeline_config=my_config)

# 6. Create and run the pipeline
pipeline_actor = ray.get(
    coordinator.create_pipeline_actor.remote(pipeline_config=my_config)
)
ray.get(pipeline_actor.run.remote())
```

See [examples/](examples/) for complete multi-pipeline examples and full configuration options.

## Pipeline Types

RLix currently supports two built-in pipeline types:

### Full Finetune Pipeline (`RollFullFinetunePipeline`)

Full-parameter training with elastic GPU expand/shrink. Each job trains all model weights while yielding idle GPUs to other jobs.

### Multi-LoRA Pipeline (`RollMultiLoraPipeline`)

Concurrent training of multiple LoRA adapters on a shared base model, with an isolated optimizer for each adapter. Jobs share the base model in GPU memory while keeping adapter weights and optimizer states fully independent.

Beyond these built-in options, RLix supports custom pipelines and integrations that follow the RLix control-plane protocol.

## Architecture

RLix separates scheduling from per-pipeline training logic: a shared control plane coordinates multiple independent jobs, while rollout stages elastically consume residual GPU capacity.

## Scheduling Policy

The scheduler assigns GPUs in priority order, with lower values indicating higher priority. All stages except rollout are non-preemptable: once they acquire GPUs, they keep them until completion. Rollout (6) is the lowest-priority stage and is always preemptable, using only the capacity remaining after all higher-priority stages are satisfied. When multiple jobs roll out concurrently, the remaining GPUs are divided proportionally to each job’s outstanding rollout demand, subject to placement constraints.

* **0 Initialization**: Model loading; must complete before scheduling begins.
* **1 Actor Training**: Policy gradient update.
* **2 Critic Training**: Value function update.
* **3 Old-Policy Log Probs**: Log-probability computation under the previous policy.
* **4 Reference-Model Log Probs**: Log-probability computation under the reference model.
* **5 Value Compute**: Value estimation for advantage calculation.
* **6 Rollout**: Trajectory sampling; always preemptable.
