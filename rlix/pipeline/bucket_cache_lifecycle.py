"""Version-tracked lifecycle manager for ROLL's CPU bucket cache.

ROLL's CPU bucket cache is split across two calls:
  1. ``_build_latest_bucket_cache(version)`` — called *inside* ``train_step``
     when ``DO_TIME_SHARING=True``. Gathers weights from all PP ranks into
     the cache owner's CPU memory.
  2. ``promote_active_checkpoint(version)`` — called by the *pipeline* after
     ``train_step`` returns. Atomically commits the just-built version as the
     one that ``selective_sync_active_cache`` (expand path) will use.

This split allows a new version to be built concurrently while the previous
active version is being broadcast to inference workers.

``BucketCacheLifecycle`` wraps these two calls with:
  - ``_cache_ready_step``: the version number of the last successfully
    promoted cache. ``-1`` = base model (pre-training).
  - ``promote(version)``: calls ``promote_active_checkpoint`` on all training
    workers and updates ``_cache_ready_step``.
  - ``is_ready_for_version(version)``: fast check used by the scheduler to
    decide whether expand is safe.

Why a separate class?
    The NeMo RL port (see ``plans/nemorl-port-plan.md`` Feature 4) needs to
    re-implement the same lifecycle without ROLL's internal ``train_step``
    hook.  Encapsulating the version accounting here makes it easy to swap
    the ROLL-backed implementation for a NeMo-backed one without touching
    the pipeline orchestration layer.

Thread / Ray safety:
    ``_cache_ready_step`` is written only by the pipeline actor (single
    writer), so no locking is needed at this level.  ROLL's
    ``promote_active_checkpoint`` acquires ``_cache_lock`` internally.
