# rules to agent
- use easy English for non-native speakers and junior engineers; use short sentences and simple words
- avoid jargon (even if common in software engineering); prefer plain words. If a technical term is necessary, define it in one short sentence (e.g., avoid "cross-cutting" and use "shared/system-wide" instead)
- try to reuse the codebase as much as possible  
- fail fast and loudly 

# Repository Guidelines

This repository is a multi-framework workspace for SchedRL design + integration across several RL/post-training stacks.

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `design_doc/`: SchedRL design docs (protocols, adaptation plans).
- `third_party/`: third-party repos as git submodules.
- `third_party/nemo-rl/`, `third_party/nemo-gym/`: NeMo-RL and environment components.
- `third_party/ROLL/`: ROLL framework (Ray-based multi-role pipelines).
- `third_party/miles/`: Miles RL framework + rollout engines.
- `third_party/SkyRL/`: SkyRL train/agent framework.
- `third_party/sglang/`, `third_party/vllm/`: rollout engines.
- Each framework has its own packaging (`pyproject.toml` / `setup.py`) and its own `tests/` folder.

If a submodule folder is missing locally, run `git submodule update --init`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Run commands from the relevant subproject root:

- ROLL: `cd third_party/ROLL && make test` (pytest) and `make precommit`.
- NeMo-RL (uses `uv`): `cd third_party/nemo-rl && uv sync` and `uv run --group test pytest -q`.
- Miles: `cd third_party/miles && pytest -q` (or follow `third_party/miles/docs/` and examples).
- SkyRL: `cd third_party/SkyRL &&` follow `third_party/SkyRL/README.md` and `third_party/SkyRL/skyrl-train/` examples.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Python: 4-space indentation; prefer explicit names over abbreviations.
- Follow the tooling and conventions of the subproject you’re changing:
  - `third_party/nemo-rl/`: `ruff` + `black` configured in `third_party/nemo-rl/pyproject.toml` (run via `uv`).
  - `third_party/ROLL/`: `pre-commit` hooks (`make precommit`).
- Keep edits scoped: avoid reformatting unrelated files.

## Testing Guidelines

- Use `pytest`; keep new tests next to the framework they cover under `*/tests/`.
- Prefer the smallest test that reproduces the behavior (unit → integration → e2e).

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Commit history here uses short, imperative summaries (e.g., `readme`); keep subjects concise.
- PRs should include: what changed, why, and which framework(s) it impacts.
- For protocol changes, update `design_doc/multi-pipeline-adaptation-plan_clean.md` and keep `design_doc/multi-pipeline_roll_old_design.md` as the reference sequence.
